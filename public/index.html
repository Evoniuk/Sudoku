      <header>ABOUT SUDOKU</header>

      <p>Sudoku, despite the Japanese name (which means 'single number'), was invented in America by Indiana man Howard Garns. Garns was a 74 year old retired architect, and made puzzles as a hobby. The first Sudoku games were published in 1979 by <cite>Dell Magazines </cite> and called Number Place. It was introduced in Japan in 1984.</p>

      <p>In 1997 Hong Kong judge Wayne Gould saw a partly completed puzzle in a Japanese bookstore and subsequently wrote a computer program to make unique puzzles automatically. After this, <cite>The Times</cite> in Britain started publishing the puzzle. It subsequently went on to garner incredible popularity in both the UK and United States.</p>

      <header>HOW TO PLAY</header>
